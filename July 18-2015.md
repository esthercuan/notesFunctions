# JQuery 

- $ is the same as typing jQuery.(“”); 
- You can call ID’s in jQuery by using the `#` sign. 
- You can also call methods to your code such as: `$(#my-teaser).html()` which will return the html inside the `my-teaser` ID. 

## What is mustache templates? 

Every part you want to be dynamic, wrap in double “mustaches” {{}} 

	<div   class=“card” style=“background-image: url({{image}})”>
	    <div  class=“cast”>{{cast}}</div>
	    <div  class=“teaser”>{{teaser}}</div>
	</div> 

When would you want to inline css or not? 
Well, it would only work when you are trying to be dynamic. In the example above the `style="background-image: url();` is the *inline* css that is going to be dynamically changed by our mustaches. 


After doing that we need to "stamp-out" our html. Now we are going to hide that html in a script tag in order for the browser to not load it yet. (This is the part you want to stamp-out over and over)

	<script id="my-template" type="x-tmpl-mustache">
		<div   class="card" style="background-image: url({{image}})">
		    <div  class="cast">{{cast}}</div>
		    <div  class="teaser">{{teaser}}</div>
		</div> 
	</script>

You want to go ahead and code your "static" stuff. It could be your hero image, your navigation bar, etc. Then when you code your JS file you would refer to this script like this: 

	function doStuff(){
		var templateText = $('#my-template').html();
		console.log(templateText);
	}



Now would be a good time to include the moustache library under our jQuery call. We should have around 3 files for JS. Two libraries and one personal one. 

	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mustache.js/2.1.2/mustache.min.js"></script>


A way to see how this is working is to code 
		
		$('body').append(templateText);

into your `doStuff()` function. This will append your original divs inside the body. Your function would look like this: 

	
	function doStuff(){
		var templateText = $('#my-template').html();
		console.log(templateText);

		$('body').append(templateText);
	}

Then in the console, if you call `doStuff()` then it will be pushing your divs into the `body` tag. The more you call `doStuff()` the more divs you will be generating! 

Now, we need to call the Mustache library. This way we can replace the `{{image}},{{cast}},{{teaser}}` with actual content. 

	
	Mustache.render(templateText,daValues);

.render is going to take the html stored in the `templateText` variable and go ahead and call `daValues` in order to replace them. So where is `daValues`? Here it is, we make it! 

	var daValues = {
	'image': '1.jpg',
	'cast':'Esther Cuan',
	'teaser':'In a WORLD... full of dinosaurs'
	};


so basically `Mustache.render(html,valuesToChange)` takes the html and the values. Remember that render() is a function in the mustache library that takes two arguments. These two arguments are the html and the values to substitute. 


Now, at this point we are still hard coding these values, but we will eventually call a database and change the values of the object! 

You can even make this more dynamic by making `doStuff` take three parameters and substitute your object with the variables: 




	function doStuff(image,cast,teaser){
		//REACH OUT and grab your raw template
		var templateText = $('#my-template').html();
		// Deine your dynamic values
		var daValues = {
			'image': image,
			'cast': cast,
			'teaser': teaser
		};
		var renderedText = Mustache.render(templateText,daValues);
		$('body').append(renderedText);
	}


	

The number one goal of software engineering is to hide functions and hide the implementations from the outside world. When you call a function, you don't know how it works, the truth is that you don't care. This is why libraries such as Mustache or jQuery are great! 

We can now call all these libraries and use their functions!
