# JQuery 

- $ is the same as typing jQuery.(“”); 
- You can call ID’s in jQuery by using the `#` sign. 
- You can also call methods to your code such as: `$(#my-teaser).html()` which will return the html inside the `my-teaser` ID. 

## What is mustache templates? 

Every part you want to be dynamic, wrap in double “mustaches” {{}} 

	<div   class=“card” style=“background-image: url({{image}})”>
	    <div  class=“cast”>{{cast}}</div>
	    <div  class=“teaser”>{{teaser}}</div>
	</div> 

When would you want to inline css or not? 
Well, it would only work when you are trying to be dynamic. In the example above the `style="background-image: url();` is the *inline* css that is going to be dynamically changed by our mustaches. 


After doing that we need to "stamp-out" our html. Now we are going to hide that html in a script tag in order for the browser to not load it yet. (This is the part you want to stamp-out over and over)

	<script id="my-template" type="x-tmpl-mustache">
		<div   class="card" style="background-image: url({{image}})">
		    <div  class="cast">{{cast}}</div>
		    <div  class="teaser">{{teaser}}</div>
		</div> 
	</script>

You want to go ahead and code your "static" stuff. It could be your hero image, your navigation bar, etc. Then when you code your JS file you would refer to this script like this: 

	function doStuff(){
		$('#my-template');
	}
