# JQuery 

- $ is the same as typing jQuery.(“”); 
- You can call ID’s in jQuery by using the `#` sign. 
- You can also call methods to your code such as: `$(#my-teaser).html()` which will return the html inside the `my-teaser` ID. 

## What is mustache templates? 

Every part you want to be dynamic, wrap in double “mustaches” {{}} 

	<div   class=“card” style=“background-image: url({{image}})”>
	    <div  class=“cast”>{{cast}}</div>
	    <div  class=“teaser”>{{teaser}}</div>
	</div> 

When would you want to inline css or not? It would only work when you are trying to be dynamic. In the example above the `style="background-image: url();` is the *inline* css that is going to be dynamically changed by our mustaches.
