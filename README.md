# Programming Notes on Javascript
Welcome! These are a collection of notes that I've taken during class in order to help my fellow students catch up with the class. 
## How to navigate them 
If you are part of the GA FEWD-32 class, then you should be able to locate which class is what by the date. If you are not part of our class, you may click on the earliest date up to the latest. 
  1. The first notes focus on declaring functions, variables and data types. 
  2. The second set of notes is a review of homework excersies and Arrays, Loops and Objects 
  3. The last set of notes focus on a breif introduction to jQuery, Callback functions and a step by step guide to implement the Mustache Template Library. 
  
  Hope you guys are able to find these helpful! 
  
  yours,
